***

**Data:** The German credit scoring data is a dataset provided by Prof. Hogmann. The data set has information about 1000 individuals, on the basis of which they have been classified as risky or not.

**Goal:** Compare the performance of various classification models on predicting the risk of the loans for 1000 individuals.

**Approach:** Compare the asymmetric cost for train and test set for 4 different classification models.

**Major Findings:** In this case, predictive power of GAM > Logistic Regression > Neural Network >  Classification Tree
